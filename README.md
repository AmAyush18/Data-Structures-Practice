# Data-Structures Practice Problems
Data Structure Problems that I solve will be uploaded in this repo.

First give it a try for a while and then only refer to solution.
You can follow 20-40-60 rule before refering to solutions:
20 mins to easy qsn.
40 mins to medium qsn.
60 mins to hard qsn.

Also I would say only refer if you're having no clue about how to do it, if you're able to imagine a way, a data structure 
or an algo you think may get you to right solution. Go On... Give it a try... 
Failing is best way of learning.
