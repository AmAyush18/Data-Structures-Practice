# LeetCode-Daily
LeetCode Daily Solutions of my attempted Questions will be posted in this repo on regular basis Under a topic folder of the Question.

First to give it a try for a while and then only refer to solution.
You can follow 20-40-60 rule before refering to solutions:
20 mins to easy qsn.
40 mins to medium qsn.
60 mins to hard qsn.

Also I would say only refer if you're having no clue about how to do it, if you're able to imagine a way, a data structure 
or an algo you think may get you to right solution. Go On... Give it a try... 
Failing is best way of learning.
